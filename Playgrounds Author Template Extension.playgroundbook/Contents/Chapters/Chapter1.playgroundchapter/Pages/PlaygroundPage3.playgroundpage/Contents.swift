 ## But ... where are the fireworks?
 I tried for a whole week to change the **circular shape** of the explosions, tried to get passionate about the subject, but by trying to the end I didn't succeed and I fell into insecurity.
 
 I reflected on my entire work and asked myself:
 
 why continue? **better to stop writing, better to stop programming.**
 
 ## But in the end I asked myself:
creating something I like from a failure is what will give me the strength to continue. Being able to **communicate everything** I have tried will make me remember not to fall into doubt anymore.
 
 ## End:
One thing I learned during this period is that fireworks are used symbolically to ward off the negativity of the old year and improve the next one.
 
 So I hope these fireworks can help someone get through a bad time.
