 # Getting lost in yourself!
 
 ## What do I want to do in life?
 
 Maybe it happened just before the university or maybe at the end of a relationship, but we all asked ourselves
 at least once what we want to do with our lives.
 
 Some people are lucky and without
 too many difficulties are able to find an answer to this question, **others a little less.**
 
 ## Depression and dissatisfaction:
 Not finding the purpose of one's life can become an obsession for people. Insecurities and fears lead to
 feeling inadequate for life and preventing us from reacting.
 
 In this situation **we see the world with different eyes**, and we are beginning to hate ourselves and our surroundings.
 
 ## See the world and people for what they are not:
 Not being able to appreciate ourselves leads us to **see negativity** all over the world. Explore your surroundings **with the camera.**
