# Fireworks-WWDC19
My Playground aims to communicate with its history and technology the emotions I felt during the trip to participate in this WWDC19 Scholarships. The playground consists of 3 pages + an introduction made using Hype3 and a video created by me. The first real page of the book uses AVFoundation and its video capture function with a CoreImage filter (CIEdges). These two technologies are used to give the reader a distorted view of the world, a vision further accentuated by a label in UIKit to which a scrolling animation has been applied. For this page there were two possible solutions according to the documentation, namely Metal or AVFoundation. I chose the latter because the Metal bees didn't completely convince me and I was already familiar with AVFoundation, I also noticed that the effect applied with AVFoundation had a visual imperfection that in this circumstance was much more immersed. The second page uses PlaygroundSupport to send data to the LiveView and modify the ARKit scene. This page generates three-dimensional words that can be traversed to then capture them. Finally on the last page I used AVFoundation again but this time with CAEmitterLayer to generate explosions that can be changed in colors using PlaygroundSupport.
